# website-builder

This builds a docker image called `website-builder`, which, when built
by CircleCI (which happens on every commit), is uploaded to DockerHub

This image is designed to build hugo based websites with support for
postcss and tailwind.

Typical usage for that image from the desktop would be something like:

```
docker run -t --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/home/node/project nokomisdotcom/website-builder
```

From the directory where your hugo website is checked out in.  The
resulting build will be in the `public` directory.

## Details on the Image

The image has the following capabilities:

- **hugo** is installed (at `/usr/bin/hugo`)
- **aws-cli** tools (version 1) are installed to allow you to upload
  the website you've built or do anything else you need on AWS
- **node** is installed to allow you to use postcss and tailwind.  In
  particular the latest versions of the following modules are installed
  globally:
  - autoprefixer
  - postcss
  - postcss-cli
  - postcss-import
  - tailwindcss
  - tw-elements
